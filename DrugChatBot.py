def predict(user_input):
    """
    Predicts the response of a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model.

    Parameters:
        user_input (str): The user's input message to be processed by the chatbot.

    Returns:
        list of tuple: A list of tuples containing the chatbot's responses in the form of (user_input, chatbot_response).
                       Each tuple represents a single back-and-forth message exchange in the conversation.

    Description:
        The `predict` function interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model to generate the chatbot's response based
        on the conversation history stored in the `message_history` variable. It appends the user's input to the message
        history and then sends the entire conversation to the language model using the `openai.ChatCompletion.create`
        method.

        The function extracts the chatbot's reply from the response and adds it to the message history. The final
        response is then constructed as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the user's input and the chatbot's
        corresponding response.

    Example:
        # Initializing the conversation with a system message and an assistant prompt
        message_history = [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are OrderBot, an automated service to collect orders for an online drug delivery. ...'},
                           {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Please provide the Symptoms or specific medicine name which you would like to Order'}]

        # User input
        user_input = "I have a headache and need some medicine."

        # Calling the predict function to get the chatbot's response
        response = predict(user_input)

        # The 'response' variable will now contain the chatbot's reply as a list of tuples.
        # Each tuple in the list represents one message exchange in the conversation.
        # Example: [('I have a headache and need some medicine.', 'Please provide the specific medicine name you'd like to order.')]
